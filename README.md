# BreakoutUnlimitedDeluxe
BreakOut recreation project for Java programming classes in PW.

This project is a task for *PROZ* classes in EITI PW. Aims for:
* Implementing a nice, easily resizeable random level generator
* Adding all base features of Breakout clone thanks to event handling
* Making a nice menu with options in the beginning (and which i failed miserably on)

To play, go to /out/artifacts/BreakoutUnlimitedDeluxe_jar/BreakoutUnlimitedDeluxe.jar;
To look up the code source, go to /src.
